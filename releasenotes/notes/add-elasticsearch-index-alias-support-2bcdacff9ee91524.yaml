    The config setting 'index_name' now refers to the index alias used to
    reference the latest cloudkitty index. If no index or index alias exists on
    first run then they will be created. If 'index_name' already exists and is
    not an alias then initialisation will fail - a simple solution is to use a
    new 'index_name' and reindex existing data into the first index created.
